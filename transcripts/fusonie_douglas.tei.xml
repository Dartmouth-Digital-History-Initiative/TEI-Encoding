    <body>
      <u who="FUSONIE">few-SO-nee, yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Glad to be here.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">—braving the rain and speaking with me. So just to start, could you maybe talk about your childhood: where you were born, way back at the beginning?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">I mean, we have plenty of time,—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Oh, okay.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">—so we can dive into—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Okay, all right.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">—your childhood and your experiences at <orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_0">Dartmouth</orgName>.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Okay. My childhood. I had a brother, and we grew up in <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_0">Connecticut</placeName> and <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_1">Rhode Island</placeName>, and we played a lot of sports, and my dad was—had played football—in fact, here—and coached, so we—you know, we were into sports.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Mmm.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Big city. [Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Big high school, you know. I came from the suburbs, but I went to this high school. It was Catholic Boys’ High, which was on the corner of the city, and it took city, suburbs, and I went from a class of 13 to one with there were 500 boys in my class,—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow!</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">—3,000 in the school.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.] You mentioned—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">—but it was a shock.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Sorry. You mentioned your father graduated from here.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">He did.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Oh. Oh, okay.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE"><persName ref="#dvp_028_person_0">Albert Fusonie</persName>?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE"><persName ref="#dvp_028_person_1">Albert T. Fusonie</persName>. That’s correct, yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">[Chuckles.] With an Italian name!</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Because he had taught at <orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_1">Taft</orgName>.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">He taught—Taft. Yeah, yeah, he taught until he was 70-something.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">You know.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">That’s really cool.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">So, yeah. So anyway, I knew I was going to <orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_2">Dartmouth</orgName>, sort of. [Both chuckle.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">It was in your—in your—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Some moving.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">And was your—so your father worked as a coach and a teacher. And was your mother—did she stay in the home, or—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">My mom stayed at home, but she—she acted in plays, and she played the violin. You know, she was mostly at home, but she died young. You know, I was a freshman here when she died.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. Wow.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">From a blood clot, you know. Yeah. Anyway, so that was—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Right, West Catholic Boys High.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">And so was this private school?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No, it was a Catholic—what you call public-Catholic—we didn’t pay any tuition. The parish we came from paid the hundred dollars or whatever it was. It is now—my high school, which just gave me an award, is now dwindled down to 800 students in the inner city, and they’re—it’s a terrific school. It’s a different population. It’s mostly African-American, and 90 percent go to college.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]Three thousand.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">—because the Catholic schools started to build out in the suburbs. They went out that way.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah, so now they’re not bringing in as many children.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Instead of bringing them in, so it went out there, yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">And were—was your family deeply religious, or just kind of with school?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Probably know the Italian-Irish influence. So yes, they were religious, you know. And we are, too. Not overbearing.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Right.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">At <orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_3">Taft School</orgName>.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Okay. </u>
      <u who="CARBONE">And what was your intention behind taking that post-graduate year?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Huh!</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Oh, my!</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">And I’m right handed.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Scrawling that essay.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">That was a chore.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">I can’t even imagine.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah. But, you know, we did it, so—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah, you got into college. [Laughs.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I got in. [Laughs.] I did.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Right.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Did you apply elsewhere, or were you pretty set?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. [Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I had to all right in the SATs and my grades and so forth, but it—but it helped.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I did. And I did.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah. And baseball.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Okay.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">And I played freshman football, then I went out for freshman basketball and track at the same time, until they called me in and said, “You know, you’re gonna disappear here.” I locked myself in the library over there and did nothing but study, you know, and I went to—I don’t know what the system is. Is it a four-oh or five-oh [4.0 or 5.0]?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah, four-oh.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah, dedicating to studies, not athletics. [Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">[Laughs.] And I took all the pre-med stuff, and that was—you know, that was a chore. It was—you know, it was good. Plus I majored in English, and that was good, too, you know.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Can you talk a little bit about what—just like your freshman year was like?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Freshman year—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Arriving on campus?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">How so?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Really!</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Oh, yeah!</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Everybody did, yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Oh, my goodness.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">[Laughs.] That’s the way he talked. But—but he was funny. You know, he called us a bunch of orangutans. [Both chuckle.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Was there a strong football community?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah, yeah. I mean, the stands were packed.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Really? It was a big—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">—big draw for the student body?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Of course, he didn’t. And then another time, he said, “We’re gonna have this at such-and-such a time,” and some more hands went up and said they have an economics exam. And he was going to get that changed, but he didn’t. You know, he couldn’t do that. He changed.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.] And were you the quarterback?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yes.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Okay. </u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Oh. Wow.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Can you tell me more about <persName ref="#dvp_028_person_2">Bob Blackman</persName>? He was the football coach who showed up I think your sophomore year?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. Academics before athletics, maybe?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that—that was good. But the students were behind—interested in football, and they attended the games, and—you know.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">The mascot. You weren’t Big Green.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah, yeah, and they changed that—I remember when they were trying to figure out what they were going to call <orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_4">Dartmouth</orgName>. Finally came up with the Big Green. But it was—it was good, you know. I would have recommended this place to anybody.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Did you know coming in that you wanted to be an English major or that you wanted to go on to medical school?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">You know, I think you develop as you—as you go.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I always read a lot, and I liked English, and I liked to write, so I decided, you know, that I was going to major in English. I sure wasn’t going to major in math because that was one of my lesser [both chuckle] strengths, if you will. You’re—you’re a physics major, right?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">No, I’m not; I’m just taking a class.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">You’re taking a physics—okay.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">That was not one of my favorites, either, but I did it. [Laughs.] All of the anatomy and embryology and all of those things, I kind of—that came not easy, but it came, you know, relatively easy. I like the—physics—physics at <orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_5">Dartmouth</orgName> was a course that you had to take using calculus and analytic geometry, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE"><persName ref="#dvp_028_person_3">Mm-hm</persName>.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Whereas in the rest of the world, you took it with regular math. So I worked <date>half the summer</date> and took half the physics at <orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_6">Penn [University of Pennsylvania</orgName>], and then the other half I took at <orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_7">UNC</orgName> [<orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_8">University of North Carolina</orgName>]. [Both chuckle.] And transferred it up here.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Stay away from the <orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_9">Dartmouth</orgName>—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">And that’s how I could do English major and—and still get all this other stuff in.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">But that was the only two that I did that with. But, you know, you get a grade lower when you transfer it, but—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Oh, really?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Or a half a grade lower.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Huh!</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">I don’t think they do.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah, okay.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Just like it’s a transfer grade, but that’s interesting.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Well, suppose you transfer it from some college that you know was rather easy compared to <orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_10">Dartmouth</orgName>, then what?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">They give you the same grade?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I don’t know. Yeah. But anyway, so that’s what I did. But I—I generally liked the courses, and, as I say, morning courses we had to take because that’s when the sciences were.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Hmm. When did morning courses begin?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">What do you mean, when did they begin? That’s all we had, morning courses.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Oh! </u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">When do you go to school, in the afternoon?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Well, there’s different time blocks, yeah. You could have a class that starts at 8:50 or you could have a class that starts at 2 or one that starts at 3.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No, we didn’t have any afternoon—labs in the afternoon, laboratory. But everybody had to go to eight o’clock class, that I remember, you know. No matter what you were taking, you had an eight o’clock class. [Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">I think that would throw the current student body into revolt. </u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">[Laughs.] Yeah, I know, yeah, that’s right. One of my sons, who went to <persName ref="#dvp_028_person_4">Hamilton</persName> [College] [chuckles]—he picked something because—I said, “What course are you taking?” I forget what he told me. I said, “Why are you taking it?” Well, it’s ten o’clock. I don’t want to go to the eight o’clock class.”</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">You know, I—I—Great Issues was a great course, and I don’t know what the disagreement was, it’s so long ago, but Great Issues—we would go and have the finest speakers or important people in the country come and talk, and we had a critique it, though. Maybe they didn’t want to do that. You had to write it up, and you got graded for it. So it was either in the afternoon or evening when—when it happened.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">And every student had to take this class?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">You know, I think so, but I’m not quite sure. I don’t know very—I think we did. And then you would, you know, write your critique of it, and that was—you know, I probably missed a few, you know, like everybody. But I don’t know what the complaint was. Maybe if I read the complaint, it would refresh my memory, but—maybe it’s because they wanted us there every time, and I couldn’t make it every time.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">We’re—kind of where we will begin discussing, with this interview, and talking about <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_2">U.S.</placeName> politics and the war in <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_3">Vietnam</placeName>. But was your time here at <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_4">Dartmouth</placeName> very political, or did you feel the campus was very political?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">You know, and we didn’t have—we had—there was significant alcohol on the campus, but there weren’t many drugs. There were hardly anything. The only guys that were smoking pot were the bands, you know. And that was it, you know. So I didn’t—you know,—we didn’t—we didn’t have that. We had other things. Did we have riots?I remember one that I don’t even know what it was about except that somebody—they all got riled up, and I think they drove a bulldozer into Parkhurst Hall or something like that.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Oh, my goodness!</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I’m not sure I even remember that, but somebody told me that. Anyway, I wasn’t in it.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.] You weren’t in the bulldozer, so—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">It was <orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_11">Beta Theta Pi</orgName>.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Okay. </u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">And that was good. You know, we had a lot of—you know, lots of the football team around there, in the house, and basketball and so forth. But we also surprised people by winning the Fraternity Hums. Do they still do that?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">No, they don’t.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">That was terrific.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Can you talk more about this?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow!</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">That was a shock to everybody. [Laughs heartily.] You got all these guys on the football team doing <persName ref="#dvp_028_person_5">Dylan Thomas</persName>, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">A lot of English majors on the team, or—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No, it was—[Laughs.]  But anyway, I don’t know if they have that anymore, either.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">No, I don’t believe they do.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah, yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">There was just one food—or one dining hall on campus?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Right, right. And even when we were in the fraternity, we did dine there because fraternities didn’t have any food, so—they had beer but no food.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.] So an imbalanced diet.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah, yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Once you joined the fraternity—but did you then live there for <date>the next few years</date>?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Lived there in <date>my senior year</date>.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE"><persName ref="#dvp_028_person_6">Mm-hm</persName>. </u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">So you can’t—you can’t live in the fraternity until—it’s a special dispensation to live there when you’re a junior; otherwise, it was a senior. So, it was pretty much—I don’t know, the college wanted you to be part of the rest of the community?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">At the same time, you were part of that community, so—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. And did you feel that there was a very strong <orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_12">Dartmouth</orgName> community amongst that—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">—the guys on campus?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I did. And it was—and it was a lot of competition between the fraternities for different things, too.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">And that was okay, you know? We used to have inter-fraternity hockey and softball and, you know, touch football for the—you know. I don’t know what they do now, your fraternities or sororities—they do any kind of softball in the Common or anything like that?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">There’s some intramurals and stuff like that.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah. Well, that’s good.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah. All right.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">—from here, and did you—what were your thoughts upon graduation? What were your plans?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">She was able to go home to <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_5">North Carolina</placeName> to be close to her parents, but, you know, three kids and I wasn’t around.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No, that’s the year I was out of school. Remember, I worked a year.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Oh.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">And so you were living in <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_6">Philadelphia</placeName>.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Right.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">And when did you enter the draft? Or when did you know that you were—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Oh, I knew—I knew pretty quick. I knew when I was in medical school that as soon as I finished, I was going.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. So when you first entered, did you choose the third option of the Berry Plan that allowed you to finish all of your education before—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Okay. </u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">And they might be out in a field taking care of sore feet, hemorrhoids, and things like that, you know. We were at the hospital, taking care of blown-up people, you know.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">—<orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_13">State University</orgName>.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yes. Yes, yes. Everybody—yeah. But they didn’t end up in <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_7">Vietnam</placeName>. [Laughs.] I was the only one that did. [Laughs.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow! Indeed.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">So they were—a number of them went right into practice or they went into Stateside military, but I was sort of—sort of a combat surgeon, if you will, or whatever. And so they sent us.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Right.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">What was the—you know, what was the mood? How—what were your—were your experiences?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Well, I think it was a sad mood, you know, with <persName ref="#dvp_028_person_7">Kennedy</persName> being assassinated and it was—it was not a good—not a good time that way. But, you know, <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_8">Vietnam</placeName> was building up. <persName ref="#dvp_028_person_8">Kennedy</persName> put the first troops in <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_9">Vietnam</placeName>, and then after that, others did. And so it was not—it was—I’d—it was a big shock and a terrible situation for the nation when—when our president got assassinated,</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">That was—and then all of the investigation about who did what and, you know, all this stuff, you know, and it seemed pretty obvious to most of us that this was a Russian that did it, you know? But we didn’t really get involved at all of that skullduggery. You know, it was just a shock to have this happen. And then, of course, <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_10">Vietnam</placeName>—<placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_11">Vietnam</placeName> was going, and it’s—it’s okay in retrospect to say things about <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_12">Vietnam</placeName>, but at the time, we had a treaty. We had the SEATO [<orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_14">Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]</orgName> treaty. Do you know what that is?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Can you elaborate for our listeners.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">It’s the Southeast Asian [sic] Treaty Organization, which we belonged to. And so did <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_13">South Vietnam</placeName>, who asked for our help. And <persName ref="#dvp_028_person_9">Kennedy</persName> started it, and it was continued on, and when I was there, we had a tremendous number of troops. It was the—the North Vietnamese were basic- —it was a communist country, let’s face it. I mean, they killed so many Catholics, it’s unbelievable, you know. They chased out—and they all went into the south. But—in fact, <persName ref="#dvp_028_person_10">Hồ Chí Minh</persName> used to work in <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_14">Boston</placeName>.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Really.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">And he was a communist then. Yeah. But anyway, so—and the Viet Cong were indigenous in <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_15">South Vietnam</placeName>, and they were supplied by the North, and they were—there were to me nasty. They blew up the schoolhouse outside out base camp because it was a successful government schoolhouse, and we had to take care of all the blown-up kids, you know,—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">—and stuff like that. But it was a—it was a war that—I don’t know how to describe how it affected everybody, but what it was, was a war that we got into because of the treaty and also because we wanted to block the advancement of communism down further.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">They spit on our nurses, and when we’d come home to <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_16">Oakland</placeName> and <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_17">San Francisco</placeName>, and you still had a uniform on, and the girls would be standing there, waiting for the bus to take them to—to the place they were supposed to go, and people, yahoos would come by and spit on them. And they treated the rest of the <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_18">Vietnam</placeName> vets terrible.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Terribly. And they’re not doing that now. They protest the war, but they don’t spit on the troops anymore, you know. So that’s—that’s an improvement. Whether they like the war or not, they’re not treating our soldiers that way.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah, respectful of the individual.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">It was not—it was not nice. But anyway, so it was a very difficult war.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I had—you know, it didn’t make any difference what I felt because I was there taking care of all of the blown-up people on both sides—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">The worst injured patient would go to surgery first, because we were doctors first, you know.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">So I was not—you know, most of us were not involved with being, you know, antiwar.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">You know, we weren’t pro-war, but we weren’t antiwar.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Oh, really.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Sure, because otherwise you might get drafted right out of the middle of your residency and, you know, leave a service blank.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yep.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">So that’s the way it went.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Oh, my goodness!</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">And I ducked, and he missed, and he ended up in the pool, and that was a fine—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">He ended up right in the pool.	</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">So I said, “You know, some of these people are dangerous.” [Laughs.] So there was a lot of—I don’t know who had the most votes between the medical students at that time. You know, there was <persName ref="#dvp_028_person_11">Goldwater</persName> people and there was <persName ref="#dvp_028_person_12">Johnson</persName> people, there was <persName ref="#dvp_028_person_13">Kennedy</persName> people, there was, you know, everything.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">It was all mixed up. So it was <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_19">America</placeName>. But it was—yeah. But some people get violent, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">And I—I’m pretty much, I guess, a Republican, and I find that some of my liberal friends get—get very dangerous. [Chuckles.] But that’s my opinion.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]So you spend kind of <date>the last years of the ’60s</date> here in residency.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]So you spend kind of the last years of the ’60s here in residency.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">You mentioned that you were starting a family at this time. What was residency like, though?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Hard. It was hard. You’re on every other night, and on your night off, you probably get home at eight o’clock, you know, and the kids were already in bed because my wife couldn’t tolerate them anymore. [Laughter.] Yeah, it was not easy. But, as I say, I—my personality is such that I’d have to find some way to burn off steam or energy, and without practicing or anything, I’d go out when I could and play rugby, if I wasn’t on call. You would get the weekends off, and sometimes I had somebody cover me for a while when I went over to the field over there by the university and played, much to the chagrin of my wife, who—you know, she doesn’t like rugby. [Both chuckle.]But anyway—but it was tough. And, as I said, my wife had to—she had to deal with the grocery store and things like that, and, you know, we had to wait. I had to take out a loan here or there, but I didn’t—you know, they were nice people, and they would put off charging us until I got something. And that worked. That was good.So the kids—kids did okay, you know? But we got paid in the military. That was the on- —big difference.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">So you were paid during your residency but then on military pay afterwards.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">So what were those fellowships for?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">You would do—in addition to your ordinary, regular duty, you would do research, and you would be assigned, you know, so many patients that were on their research medication, and you’d have to go around and make sure they got it and check on them and see how they’re doing and so forth. The same with the heart one, you know. And then write it up, and trying to write something up to get a grant, to get some more money to research this, and—you know, we did some good work, you know. It worked out pretty well, you know? But that’s what it was. But, I mean, it didn’t take away from your everyday duties in surgery and making rounds and taking call and—you know. It wasn’t easy.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. Was your residency in—and, like, your duties relating to surgery—influenced all by the knowledge that you would be going to a combat zone?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No. No. You mean why did I take surgery? You know what I think? Surgery was something where you’d get an answer, okay? I’m a pretty active, you know, person, and—but you have to take the responsibility. You have to be able to take the responsibility that you’re operating on this person, and whatever happens, you’re involved. You can’t say, “They didn’t respond to the medicine,” you know, because you have a direct hand in it.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">So you have to be able to take that responsibility, and I think I could do that, and at the same time, I’d get an answer, you know? I mean, somebody has a cancer, and I operate and remove it, and they’re better, okay? It’s a lot of work, and it’s a lot of follow-up, and so—but that’s basically why—why I became a surgeon. I started out to be a psychiatrist.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah. Until I went into surgery, you know, and experienced the other aspects, and I said, you know, I like that more, you know, so—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Was that—was it in your mind, the surgery that you might be doing later on, should you be sent to <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_20">Vietnam</placeName>, when you were, you know,—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">—operating on people in <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_21">Ohio</placeName>.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I was trained in all that, because we had trauma there, too. I mean, it’s a big city hospital, you know, so we—and we had the trauma. We didn’t have as many gunshot wounds all at once—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.] I would hope not.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow!</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">But—so we lost—I don’t know, we lost one nurse and one doctor. Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Mmm.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">It was shrapnel.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.So you had mentioned earlier, after you finish your residency, you began your service.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Right.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">And what sort of surgery were you doing? Was it treating people returning from <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_22">Vietnam</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No, no. It was everything. I mean, it’s a big base camp, so you have families, and you have guys that are there. You know, they’re assigned there, and they’re on this base camp. They may never go over. But it’s a whole—there’s probably 25,000 troops or whatever it was. And so it would be—they have gall bladder problems, they have cancer problems, they have lung pro- —you know. So you’d be doing all of that. There was no combat there, you know.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">People returning, having had—you know, needing prostheses and so forth—they would go someplace else, you know.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Okay. </u>
      <u who="CARBONE">And you mentioned that following the war, you really—the antiwar protesters did not earn your respect.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">And they would lie down in front of the marching band [chuckles], <orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_15">Ohio State</orgName>’s marching band and—you know. I thought that a lot of them were—I think they had—a number of them had too much pot; that’s what I thought.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Because of her antiwar—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Woah! That’s—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">You can see the things going on out there, you know? But—so anyway, when I came home, I thought that the war protesters were nasty.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">But I think a lot of the war protesters were—first of all, they didn’t—they didn’t want to serve. You know,  they wanted to save their butt. And I understand that. And—I mean, who wanted to go? But I think that—and it was a big pot time, too, you know? It really was. Maybe it wasn’t as strong as it is now, but it was plenty of it, you know. It’s not new. And, I used to drag the corpsmen out of their hooch down there to come and help me in surgery, and sometimes I’d get them out of there and I got really mad at them because they were—they were all smoked up, you know? And the enemy was selling this stuff to them, you know. But—so anyway, I don’t—I—I think the protesters now are kinder to the troops.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">They think the troops are part of them now, you know?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, well, yes. And no. But  years later, you know, when I came back from <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_23">Vietnam</placeName> and I was in <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_24">Massachusetts</placeName>, I would come up here for reunions, and I remember tent city and all the stuff that was going on on campus [chuckles], you know. So I—yeah, I—I—I was aware of some of it, and I thought they needed to study more, but that’s [chuckles]—you know. You know, I don’t—what goes on on college campuses is somehow beyond me now in some of the things, you know. It’s—you know. I can’t remember us really protesting too much. But, then, we didn’t have the same issues, you know?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">You know, we would have if it was something that we were really into, but we didn’t have a war, you know.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah, there wasn’t something at the forefront.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah. No.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Hmm. That’s hard for me. I don’t know. [Laughs.] I can’t—I don’t know.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">You know, I’m not sure that I was—I was really into it that much,—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">—you know, because I was about to be sent to war and so forth, so it didn’t make any difference. Whatever the president was, was sending me over there, so—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">—it wasn’t going to make a difference who it was. The Pueblo incident—you know, who knows what that was? You know, that was a ship that was supposed to have been shot at by the North Vietnamese or something?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Oh.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">It got us into the war or something?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">But there’s—there’s a lot of books out, and most of them are anti the war, and then there’s some that are, you know, pro the war, you know, that says we did belong there, because we do have to honor treaties.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">One of my sons—his partner keeps going over, keeps being sent over there.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">[Chuckles.] But the military paid for his education, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">And you went—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Did I know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">No, that is not. It’s a big adjustment.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">And what as your reaction to that news?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I couldn't believe it because, you know, I was—I was the last fully-trained surgeon at that hospital. The other guys were not completely trained. But they brought in other people, so—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">It’s my turn to go, and they sent me.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">—went over?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Well, you know, an officer, which I was, is supposed to know everything, in the military. But I was a doctor, and I didn’t know much.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">And when I showed up in <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_25">Fort Eustis</placeName>, to give you an example, I went to breakfast with my new uniform on. I was a captain. And a colonel looked at me, and says, “Captain, you have all your insignias in the wrong place.”</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I had to learn all of that. And they kept sending me to <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_26">Vietnam</placeName> training. I fired every gun in the world. And then they’d send me again, send me to Fort Sam [Fort Sam Houston in <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_27">Texas</placeName>] to do the same thing, which was a waste, but—but I did. And so then I got ready to go to <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_28">Vietnam</placeName>, and my orders—and I went to <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_29">San Francisco</placeName> and took my oral boards on the way. I’d taken the written part. Surgery boards. And then went out and flew out to <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_30">Vietnam</placeName>.It’s a long trip. It was about 19 hours in the plane, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Ohh!</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Backing up a little, you mentioned that you had kind of some military training in firing weapons and stuff?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I did.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Was there any medical training to prepare you for what you would see in <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_31">Vietnam</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I mean, I was already a fully-trained surgeon, you know? I mean, they did some of that, but it was—I mean, it wasn’t much that we didn’t know, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Uh-huh. </u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">They would show you what a—what a high-velocity bullet did. You know, they would—I hate to tell you this, but it was a dead goat. They’d shoot a goat in the butt, and then you’d go look at the wound and see it went in there; it came out in the back, and so they did show you that.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">But as far as trauma goes, this was just—some of the stuff we knew, whether it was quadrupled, you know, when we were over there because it was mines and rockets and bombs and rifles and IEDs and all that stuff, you know. And people would be brought in with lots of things missing. </u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">And sometimes you had somebody look at you and ask why you saved them.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">I haven’t heard the name.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">From <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_32">Georgia</placeName>. He may still be in the <orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_16">Senate</orgName>.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Right. Well, he came through, and the bottom half of him was all blown off. He sits in a chair, and he’s happy to be alive. So you don’t know who’s going to be—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah, different reactions.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">You know, yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Oh, that is so funny. I was literally just reading an article that was about senators who are amputees.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah, yeah, yeah, <persName ref="#dvp_028_person_14">Max</persName>.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I never heard of it in my life. Oh, I’d heard that it was a place not to go.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Okay. </u>

      <u who="CARBONE">—<placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_34">Saigon</placeName>. Very—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah, I know. I know where it is.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah, no, I’m—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">[Laughs.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">—giving context.<persName ref="#dvp_028_person_15">FUSONIE	</persName>For sure. Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">But there’s a lot of activity.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">That’s a lot of surgery.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">So what—what classified as a major surgery?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yep.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah, I can’t—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">You know, they would go right in there and—So anyway, that was—it was a very hot—they have two seasons over there: hot and wet, and hot and dry. When I got there, it was, like, 100-and-some degrees. I don’t know. But anyway,—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Oh, goodness!</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">—you couldn’t spit or anything for about three days.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">But you got used to it, you know. And it was plenty—we had plenty of food. You know, there was a commissary, and we went there and had food. And there were lots of stories, but, you know, there was just a lot of trauma, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">A lot of trauma. And, we probably, on our time off, went and had a few drinks, you know. [Chuckles.] We used to sit on a tin roof when we were off sometimes, and one guy would be sitting there, having a drink, and he fell off and landed behind the sandbags. But he didn’t spill the drink.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">He came up holding it like that. [Demonstrates.] But we didn’t get much time off. But we would actually sit—sit up so we could see what was going on. They had this thing out there called the—I don’t know. it was called Puff, the Magic Dragon [Douglas AC-47 Spooky] or something, but it was a [Douglas] C-54 [Skymaster]. They still use them. With Gatling guns coming out the side. And they’d fly in a circle and just kill everything in sight, I guess, but—and you could watch the war from up on the roof of our chicken coop.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow. That’s—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">But, most of the time, we were busy, you know.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. So speaking of, though, your chicken coop, can you talk about the setup of the hospital, what it had, what it didn’t have, and then just the base at large, too?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Domed—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">—steel-domed things. And they were hooked—in fact, there’s some pictures there. They were hooked together , and they air conditioned them, thank God, with—you could see air conditioners sticking out everywhere.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Oh, yeah, in 100-degree heat without air conditioning.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Oh, you had to. You had to. So they would go along and—okay, so there’s the Emergency Room here [demonstrates], and that was a big emergency room. And then you went from there to Pre-op or Holding. That’s another—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">But it was a well supplied hospital?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">No, I have not.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Even the South Vietnamese.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">The South Vietnamese wouldn’t. The North Vietnamese would kill them.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yep.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Our government would not take care of them after we took care of them in our hos- —local hospital. You couldn’t send them to any military—I don’t know what became of them, but—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Hmm. Interesting.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Kind of left in this limbo.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">So we lost a lot of limbs. But we also had a lot of abdominal operations and a lot of chest operations from gunshot wounds and mortars and rockets, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I don’t know if there’s one injury that was more common than the other. They were all pretty much there. </u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Every one was common.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Brain injuries were pretty much almost terminal. I mean, gunshot wounds to the head were really bad, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">And where—was it equally Vietnamese civilians and American—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">—military men?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Mostly American military, but we took care of Vietnamese civilians when they got blown up for whatever rea- —little kids, you know. And we took care of the enemy, too. You know, our guys would shoot them and bring them in, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Big helicopter.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">—helicopter. And they got them all. But they were—they had a hospital underground.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow!</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Did it change your perception of the war, seeing it so physically, with all these people with, like, horrific injuries and missing limbs?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Well, yeah. War was at a distance, over there, until you get there. And I didn’t really think that I was going to be killed, although I almost—a couple of times. But not like the troops that are going out in the field, where they get killed any time.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Was it more than you had expected?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I don’t know what I expected, you know? We were all trained to do it. I don’t know what I expected, you know. But it was a—it was—a lot of different things went on, you know. We had tunnel rats come in. Do you know what a tunnel rat is?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah, there were, like—what?—18 inches or something tiny?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I don’t know, but I have claustrophobia, and you wouldn’t get me down there.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">But they followed him, I guess, you know. They said, “If he can’t make it, he can’t make it.” But he wanted to go back. That’s what they told me. I didn’t take care of him, because he wasn’t a surgical guy. [Both Chuckle.]  You know, he was for the psychiatrist that I would have been way back. [Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">The other—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah, the other profession.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Version two of you.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Were there—did a high percentage of the people that you treated then return to their units?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. Makes sense.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">And did you have—did you establish relationships with any of these patients in kind of their post-operative care, or—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No. No, because they left, and we were still there. We have had patients come back and thank us at a reunion or something. We had a reunion in <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_35">Texas</placeName>, and a couple of G.I.s came back and thanked us.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow. That’s pretty cool.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah. But, you know, most of the time you never saw them again, which is different. You know, that doctor-patient relationship is only there for the time they’re there.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. But were those interactions like with patients who had lost limbs or kind of been—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">It was hard. It was hard, you know. I think I told you about the one guy woke up, wanted to know why we didn’t just let him go, because he didn’t have any parts, you know? They’re mostly grateful. They were happy to be alive, and they knew they had a long road ahead to get, you know, a prosthesis and all the things that come later so they could walk. Yeah, a lot of them were really glad to be alive. Had been shot in the chest or something, and now they’re going to be okay. Yeah it was—it was a mixture, you know.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah, different reactions.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Was that a hard decision for some people on the base, to treat North Vietnamese?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">In his chest. </u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I knew it was going through his heart. He had a ball bearing went through his heart, so I opened his chest, put my finger in the hole in his heart and I sewed up around it, and he did okay, but, you know, it’s a—I got him before he bled to death. [Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. wow. And were the injuries that you saw amongst civilians and, like, members of any sort of fighting force—did they differ significantly?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Just, like, if there were different types of injuries that were commonly occurring.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No, it was pretty much the same. It’s all gunshot wounds, shrapnel wounds, rockets, you know.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Was there a burn unit at the hospital?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Wonderful. Great.So you’ve mentioned, like, the North Vietnamese coming in through the tunnels and blowing up—</u>
      <u who="SCHEIR">Yes.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">But—yeah. But they didn’t get in again. But their tunnels! You know, the tunnels—that’s a—that’s something. They had built those things right up under our base camp, probably, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">That’s insane.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yah. [Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">[Chuckles.] </u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah, you said it was hot and hot.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I don’t know. There were so many battles over there, I don’t know.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Nothing really stuck out to you?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Which had been that very area.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. You were kind of just in the thick of it?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">It was all over the place, so I don’t know. I don’t know any special—special battle. [Both chuckle.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Did you feel somewhat insulated from the war at all, being in the hospital, or—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">In that sense.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Right.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Well, no 16-year-olds.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Eighteen- and 19-year-olds. Well, you know, it was—it was tough, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">They would try to impress the girls, and they would fly like this [demonstrates] and then sideways, and there was—oh, my God!</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">But—so everybody—they were all young, you know. And we were older. Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Was there a distinct separation by ages, kind of?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No. You know, I don’t think so. The nurses were young, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">And what was the relationship of the people working—so the medical staff with the enlisted men and people, like, on the base?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Fine. Yeah, it was fine, you know. I’d get mad at them now and then because I had to get them out of the hooch, where they lived, because I needed an extra [chuckles]—an extra hand, and he might be smoking pot, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.] Not going to be very much help in the operating room.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Most of the time they weren’t—they were mellow, you know. But anyway, you know, most of the time they didn’t, so—you know, we—everybody got along. You had to.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">You were there, so you know, it didn’t pay to have any enemies.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah, [Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">And you kind of—you know, being older, you know, you kind of looked after them,—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">—you know, sort of. Did the best we could.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Was there a contingent of older—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">All the doctors were.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">—surgical staff?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah, all the—there were surgeons, internists, anesthesiologists, you know, oral surgeons, you know, and they were—yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Looking out for them.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">What would be different now, as you well know, is that 50 percent of the medical school class is women, so the women would be over there, which, you know, we didn’t have. Do you know how many girls were in my medical school class?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">How many?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Four.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Out of how many?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Eighty-something.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Oh, my goodness!</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">But that’s the way it was, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. Right, <orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_17">Dartmouth</orgName> was all men when you were here.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah, yeah. That’s the way it was, you know? So, you know, it’s a lot different now, and it’s a different perspective in—in—in medicine and a lot of things, which is good.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I did not see—even though it was there. I mean, I know heroin was there, but I didn’t see that. Other places, they had it. And there was no abuse of any of the—OxyContin or anything like that, so basically it was pot, you know. And maybe some of the troops maybe heroin. And it all came from the enemy, too. They were just as soon everybody was smoked up, so they could kill them easier! </u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Less formidable. [Chuckles.] </u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">In fact, we did lose a few troops, you know, that were on guard duty and then, you know, smoked up a little, kind of too relaxed and—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. [Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">But it wasn’t a—so it wasn’t a big thing, you know, but it was there, yeah. And I told the guys, you know, they’re not going to do it while they’re supposed to be operating, anyway. But it’s nothing new. You had to deal with it.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. Did you—I mean, I kind of assume you had to, but did you become desensitized to—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No. But you had to just keep going, you know. It’s a—I don’t know if you’d call that desensitized as accepting it as what it is and doing what you have to do. I mean, if you get all blown away by it, then you can’t take care of the next one, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">And you’re trained to take care of it, anyway. But, no, not desensitization. Maybe, I don’t know, accustomed to.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah, I understand what you’re—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Still recognize it as horrible. I guess if there was a typical day or a schedule that you kept to, could you walk me through that?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">[Chuckles.] And you did. You made it to <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_36">Hawaii</placeName>.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah. You know, but that was—and <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_37">Hawaii</placeName> was good, you know?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Was it—what was it like to return from, you know, <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_38">Hawaii</placeName>—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">—to <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_39">Vietnam</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE"><name type="event" ref="#dvp_028_event_0">Second World War</name>. So, anyway, war is hell.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Well, defoliant was used to do just that: defoliate, all the way to a perimeter so that you could set up a perimeter and not have bad guys sneak up on you. I mean, we had guards out on the perimeter. And that’s what it was for. And it worked very well. But unfortunately, it also has caused some damage to people.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah, and I’m pretty sure it was because it was clear, out to the mountains, you know? And the base camp—I could show you other pictures—it was just flat. There was nothing there. Roads, and no trees, no bushes, no anything. Of course, a lot of that was plowed down, but at the same time, a lot of it out there was Agent Orange.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah, just, like, immediate or burned or something?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No, you wouldn’t see it. I mean, it’s something that affects you years later. I wouldn’t have—nobody would have known, you know. No.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">No.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">They never lost a battle.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">But the—in a sense, then, lost the war with how the <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_40">U.S.</placeName> forces left.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">We got out the wrong way, and—because we didn’t have to lose a thing, but the government and the people couldn’t tolerate us being in a war any longer. That’s really it, you know.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Was it ever hard to reconcile, like, all the injuries you were seeing, all the people who were coming to the hospital with the military successes or these—you know, the winning of these battles?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Well, you would have had the injuries anyway, so if you win, it’s better. I don’t know. But I don’t like any of the injuries, whether you’re winning or losing. I would—I would hope that they would win everything around our base camp [both chuckle] so we wouldn’t get overrun, but, you know, all I know is they were—they were good—good soldiers, and they never lost a battle, you know. But we did lose, you know, 55,000 or whatever we lost, a tremendous number of troops. And I’m not sure it had to be that way, you know. But, you know, I don’t have an answer to it.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I don’t have an answer to the one that’s going on now, either. That’s beyond my comprehension. I just don’t know what they’re doing over there. I don’t think the government knows what they’re doing.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Did you feel that the government knew what it was doing while it was fighting the war in <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_41">Vietnam</placeName>?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No. I think the—I think the commanders did, but I’m not sure the government did. They were hamstrung. The commanders knew how to fight the war, but they couldn’t fight it.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. Politics got in the way at the end.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah. So I don’t know. But if you’ve got half of the population marching around and marching on <placeName ref="#dvp_028_place_42">Washington</placeName> and all over the place, I mean, you’re going to declare victory and leave, but it didn’t work that way. You know, we left with people falling off the roof or trying to get on a helicopter and everything else, you know?</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">On TV.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">See I didn’t—you know, I thought we were winning, but that’s—and I thought it wasn’t long after that that they closed the hospitals.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE"><orgName ref="#dvp_028_org_18">12th Evacuation</orgName> closed then.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">The battles were over, a lot of them.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. When you were leaving, were you aware that the usefulness of the hospital was—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">My what?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. Did—you mentioned that many returning soldiers had very—like, were not welcomed by antiwar protesters.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">I—</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Did you have any personal experience with that?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">What were their—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">They were calling me a baby killer and everything else. You know, all that stuff.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Wow.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah, but worse things have happened to other people. You know, it wasn’t—but it did happen to our nurses, and it happened to other people. And it was—that’s the way it was, you know. And they have made a conscious effort to—the protesters—to not do that to the troops now.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Awesome. Wow.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">And that’s a small town?</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Yeah. Awesome.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">My wife and I travel to visit our grandchildren and our children and their kids and so forth.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Oh, I’m—well,—</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">No, I—I—we’ve covered a lot of territory, I think. You know, I don’t know what I left out, but when you get old, you forget anyway. [Both chuckle.]</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Well, I just want to make sure you’ve put it all out there.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Yeah.</u>
      <u who="CARBONE">Great. Thank you so much. This was wonderful.</u>
      <u who="FUSONIE">Oh, thank you.[End of interview.]</u>
