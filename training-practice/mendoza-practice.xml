                Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
                Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
                Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
                Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard
                I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
                Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
                I overthink your p-punctuation use
                Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do
                A rush at the beginning
                I get caught up, just for a minute
                But lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
                Can you hear the violence?
                Megaphone to my chest
                Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
                And make 'em all dance to it
                Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
                And make 'em all dance to it
                Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
                And make 'em all dance to it
                Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
                And make 'em all dance to it
                Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
                And make 'em all dance to it
                Our thing progresses, I call and you come through
                Blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you
                But we're the greatest, they'll hang us in the <placeName>Louvre</placeName> 
                Down the back, but who cares, still the <placeName>Louvre</placeName>
                Okay I know that you are not my type (still I fall)
                I'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (but what about love?)
                Nothing wrong with it, supernatural
                Just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting
                A rush at the beginning
                I get caught up, just for a minute
                But lover, you're the one to blame, all that you're doing
                Can you hear the violence?
                Megaphone to my chest
                Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
                And make 'em all dance to it
                Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
                And make 'em all dance to it
                Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
                And make 'em all dance to it
                Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
                And make 'em all dance to it
                Broadcast the boom boom boom boom
                And make 'em all dance to it
