                Hold on, don't fight your war alone
                Halo around you, don't have to face it on your own
                We will win this fight
                All souls be brave
                We'll find a way to heaven
                We'll find a way
                
                War is old, so is sex
                Let's play god, you go next
                Hands go up, men go down
                Try my luck, stand my ground
                Die in church, live in jail
                Say her name, twice in hell
                <persName>Uncle Sam</persName> kissed a man

                I like my woman in the kitchen
                I teach my children superstitions
                I keep my two guns on my blue nightstand
                A pretty young thang, she can wash my clothes
                But she'll never ever wear my pants
                
                I pledge allegiance to the flag
                Learned the words from my mom and dad
                Cross my heart and I hope to die
                With a big old piece of American pie
                Love me baby, love me for who I am
                Fallen angels singing, "clap your hands"
                Don't try to take my country, I will defend my land
                I'm not crazy, baby, naw
                I'm American
                I'm American
                I'm American
                I'm American
                
                Seventy-nine cent to your dollar
                All that bullshit from <orgName>white-collars</orgName>
                You see my color before my vision
                Sometimes I wonder if you were blind
                Would it help you make a better decision?
                
                I pledge allegiance to the flag
                Learned the words from my mom and dad

                With a big old piece of American pie
                Just love me baby, love me for who I am
                Fallen angels singing, "clap your hands"
                Don't try to take my country, I will defend my land
