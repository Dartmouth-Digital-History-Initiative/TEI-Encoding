                Thought I'd end up with Sean <persName>Big Sean</persName>
                But he wasn't a match
                Wrote some songs about Ricky <persName>Ricky Alvarez</persName>
                Now I listen and laugh
                Even almost got married
                And for Pete <persName>Pete Davidson</persName>, I'm so thankful
                Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm <persName>Mac Miller</persName>
                'Cause he was an angel
                One taught me love
                One taught me patience
                And one taught me pain
                Now, I'm so amazing
                Say I've loved and I've lost
                But that's not what I see
                So, look what I got
                Look what you taught me
